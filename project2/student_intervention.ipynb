    "** Decision Tree Classifier **   \n",
    "A decision tree classifier is typically used when the input features are a mix of both continuous and discrete types as a decision tree classifier can easily handle such type of data. Decision trees are also very easy to interpret and hence are used in applications where it might be useful to know the relative importance of features in classifying a particular input data sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Strengths* \n",
    "1. Easy to interpret, visualize \n",
    "2. Similar to how humans make decisions \n",
    "3. Easily handle discrete/qualitative data types in the features\n",
    "4. Relatively lower complexity implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "*Weaknesses*\n",
    "1. Prone to overfitting \n",
    "2. High variance, i.e., small changes in the data may result in very different trees \n",
    "\n",
    "*Why we choose this model?*  \n",
    "Based on the given dataset, we observe that almost all the predictors are qualitative. We also observe that the problem is to identify students who might fail to graduate for early intervention. Hence it is important that we have a simple model that can be interpreted easily, i.e., we should be able to easily identify that important predictors responsible for a student success/failure. Therefore, decision tree classifier is an appropriate model for this problem.   \n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "** Support Vector Machine (SVM) **  \n",
    "SVMs are typically used to model high dimensional data when only a limited amount of data is available for training such as text processing applications like sentiment analysis, document classification etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Strengths*\n",
    "1. As the SVM classifier uses only the support vectors to do the actual classification, SVMs are memory efficient. \n",
    "2. A SVM is also robust to some noisy/outlier data points in the dataset as again the classification depends only on a few support vectors. This makes is resistant to overfitting. \n",
    "3. SVMs can be used for high dimensional datasets where only a limited number of samples are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Weaknesses*\n",
    "1. Difficult to interpret the model, especially when using non-linear kernels in the SVM.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Why we choose this model?*  \n",
    "As we have many predictors (48), but relatively few observations in our training dataset (300), we choose SVM as a candidate for this problem. One of our objectives is also to use as little data as possible for training the model, hence SVM can be a good candidate for example when using a training set size of 100. \n",

    "\n",
    "** K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) Classifier **  \n",
    "K-NN is an instance based learning algorithm where the entire training dataset is stored as our model and used to make predictions. The K nearest neighbor datapoints in the training set to the given input sample are identified and their labels are averaged/majority voted to make a prediction/classification. \n",

Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",

The training algorithm first chooses a single predictor variable to split the data set. For e.g., let us hypothetically assume that most of the male students fail and most of the female students pass according to our dataset, then the algorithm chooses the ``Sex`` variable for the first split as it would nicely split the dataset into two groups having a majority of the same output labels. This process is then continued to identify more variables to split on at further levels and splitting the dataset until we have groups/subsets of the training dataset where all the data points in each group have the same output label i.e., either ``yes`` or ``no`` for the ``passed`` label. \n",
